    "Today, Naive Bayes is one of the most used Supervised Learning models. A very important example is related with Cancer treatment, \"Application of the Naïve Bayesian Classifier to optimize treatment decisions\" Book (Radiotherapy and Oncology Volume 86, Issue 2, February 2008, Pages 211–216). Another example is related with consumer credit scoring. One real example is with ZOPA a loan company (https://www.zopa.com) that uses the NB to classify and define a credit score for client (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6282321/?reload=true). Another important application of NB is related with the email classifier applied to identify SPAMs, it uses a method called bag of words to quantify the words and provide a dataset for the Naive Bayes application (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths**\n",
    "It is considered very easy to implement and efficient for training, in terms of the total number of computations needed. Also, naive Bayes performs well on many different training tasks. The \"good\" part of being naive is that even with a small number of training data it can satisfactory estimate the parameters necessary for classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weaknesses**\n",
    "Because of the strong conditional independence assumption placed on the attributes in the model, there are situations where naive Bayes is not appropriate. The \"naive\" part of the algorithm can potencially ends with bad predictions, in the case where two ore more features, together, have a completely different meaning than when are all features being analysed independently. \n",
    "i.e.: \"Chicago Bulls\" means the Basketball team but when seeing in the naive way are just Chicago (city) and bulls (the animal).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why a good candidate**\n",
    "Considering our problem a Classification problem, Naive Bayes is one of the most simple and effective Classifiers models, even if the expected assumption doesn’t hold, a Naive Bayes classifier still often does a great job in practice. \n",

Decision trees have helped in star-galaxy classification, determining galaxy counts and discovering quasars in the Second Palomar Sky Survey (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html). Also it was recently successfuly applied to NLP part-of-speech disambiguation and unknown word guessing (Decision Trees and NLP: A Case Study in POS Tagging, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f346/e045535f6928c4c404b86d2d6b317c3b5d8b.pdf).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Weaknesses**\n",
    "Based on the concept of the Decision tree and the way the nodes are associate with each others, there is a considerable risk of overfitting.  The decision tree can change significantly at any dataset change. This is not desirable as we want our classification algorithm to be pretty robust to noise and be able to generalize well to future observed data. Considering the  growth of the tree, for each new feature the algorithm may need to recalculate the entire tree resulting in bad performance (Utgoff, P. E. (1989). Incremental induction of decision trees. Machine learning, 4(2), 161-186.).\n",

    "An example of Logistic Regression might be to predict whether an American voter will vote Democratic or Republican, based on age, income, sex, race, state of residence, votes in previous elections (Harrell, Frank E. (2001). Regression Modeling Strategies. Springer-Verlag. ISBN 0-387-95232-2.).  It is also used in marketing applications such as prediction of a customer's propensity to purchase a product or halt a subscription (Berry, Michael J.A (1997). Data Mining Techniques For Marketing, Sales and Customer Support. Wiley. p. 10.) web: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths**\n",
    "In Logistic Regression you don’t have to worry if your features are correlated, like you do in Naive Bayes. You also easily update your model to take in new data and have a nice probabilistic interpretation, unlike decision trees. (http://blog.echen.me/2011/04/27/choosing-a-machine-learning-classifier/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weaknesses**\n",
    "Logistic regression attempts to predict outcomes based on a set of independent variables, but those models are vulnerable to overfit. That is, the models can appear to have more predictive power than they actually do as a result of sampling bias. The features need to be well selected, if we include the wrong independent variables, the model will have little to no predictive value. (http://classroom.synonym.com/disadvantages-logistic-regression-8574447.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why a good candidate**\n",
    "Considering our problem a Classification problem, Logistic regression is a pretty well-behaved classification algorithm that can be trained as long as you expect your features to be roughly linear and the problem to be linearly separable.
